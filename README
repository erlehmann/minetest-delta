Minetest Δ (“Minetest Delta”) is a fork of Minetest-c55 <http://celeron.55.lt/~celeron55/minetest/>, which incorporated experimental features that were not included in Minetest-c55.
Development of Minetest Δ has ceased on August 04, 2011. As every feature of Minetest Δ was merged upstream, it is now considered obsolete.

Minetest Δ still contains graphics different from Minetest-c55:
* Player
* Omsk birds (instead of Oerkki ghosts)
* Rat
* Glass
* Heart

Building on GNU/Linux or OS X:
    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1
    make -j2

The “upstream” branch contains vanilla minetest-c55, created using:
    hg-fast-export -r ~/share/src/games/minetest -o upstream
    git push origin upstream/master:upstream -f

All new/replaced graphics done by erlehmann are dual-licensed under GPL (version 2 or, at your option, any later version) and CC-BY-SA (version 3.0 or, at your option, any later version).
