Minetest Δ (“Minetest Delta”) is a fork of Minetest-c55 <http://celeron.55.lt/~celeron55/minetest/>, incorporating experimental features that are not (yet) included in Minetest-c55.
Currently it is considered the unstable development branch of Minetest-c55, which means almost everything is merged upstream from Minetest Δ.

New features:
* refactored liquids (should not affect gameplay)
* translation support (including german, french, italian)

New blocks:
* ladders (crafted from 7 sticks in a H form)

Alternate graphics:
* Player
* Omsk birds (instead of Oerkki ghosts)
* Rat
* Glass
* Heart

Building on GNU/Linux or OS X:
    cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1
    make -j2

The “upstream” branch contains vanilla minetest-c55, created using:
    hg-fast-export -r ~/share/src/games/minetest -o upstream
    git push origin upstream/master:upstream -f
