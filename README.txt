This game is not finished:
--------------------------
- Don't expect it to work as well as a finished game will.
- Please report any bugs to me. debug.txt is useful.

Controls:
---------
- See the in-game pause menu
- Settable in the configuration file, see the section below.

Map directory:
--------------
- Map is stored in a directory, which can be removed to generate a new map.
- There is a command-line option for it: --map-dir
- For a RUN_IN_PLACE build, it is located in:
		../map
- Otherwise something like this:
	Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\minetest\map
	Linux: ~/.minetest/map
	OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/minetest/map

Configuration file:
-------------------
- An optional configuration file can be used. See minetest.conf.example.
- Path to file can be passed as a parameter to the executable:
	--config <path-to-file>
- Defaults:
	- If built with -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1:
		../minetest.conf
		../../minetest.conf
	- Otherwise something like this:
		Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\minetest\minetest.conf
		Linux: ~/.minetest/minetest.conf
		OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/minetest.conf

Command-line options:
---------------------
- Use --help

Compiling on GNU/Linux:
-----------------------

Install dependencies. Here's an example for Debian/Ubuntu:
$ apt-get install build-essential libirrlicht-dev cmake libbz2-dev libpng12-dev libjpeg8-dev libxxf86vm-dev libgl1-mesa-dev

Download source, extract (this is the URL to the latest of source repository, which might not work at all times):
$ wget https://bitbucket.org/celeron55/minetest/get/tip.tar.gz
$ tar xf tip.tar.gz
$ cd minetest

Build a version that runs directly from the source directory:
$ cmake . -DRUN_IN_PLACE=1
$ make -j2

Run it:
$ cd bin
$ ./minetest

- Use cmake . -LH to see all CMake options and their current state
- If you want to install it system-wide (or are making a distribution package), you will want to use -DRUN_IN_PLACE=0
- You can build a bare server or a bare client by specifying -DBUILD_CLIENT=0 or -DBUILD_SERVER=0
- You can select between Release and Debug build by -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug or Release>
  - Note that the Debug build is considerably slower

Compiling on Windows:
---------------------

- You need:
	* CMake:
		http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
	* MinGW or Visual Studio
		http://www.mingw.org/
		http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default
	* Irrlicht SDK 1.7:
		http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
	* Zlib headers (zlib125.zip)
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
	* Zlib library (zlibwapi.lib and zlibwapi.dll from zlib125dll.zip):
		http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
	* gettext bibrary and tools:
		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php
	* And, of course, Minetest-c55:
		http://celeron.55.lt/~celeron55/minetest/download
- Steps:
	- Select a directory called DIR hereafter in which you will operate.
	- Make sure you have CMake and a compiler installed.
	- Download all the other stuff to DIR and extract them into there. All those
	  packages contain a nice base directory in them, which should end up being
	  the direct subdirectories of DIR.
	- You will end up with a directory structure like this (+=dir, -=file):
	-----------------
	+ DIR
		- zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
		- zlib125dll.zip
		- irrlicht-1.7.1.zip
		- 110214175330.zip (or whatever, this is the minetest source)
		+ zlib-1.2.5
			- zlib.h
			+ win32
			...
		+ zlib125dll
			- readme.txt
			+ dll32
			...
		+ irrlicht-1.7.1
			+ lib
			+ include
			...
		+ gettext
			+bin
			+include
			+lib
		+ minetest
			+ src
			+ doc
			- CMakeLists.txt
			...
	-----------------
	- Start up the CMake GUI
	- Select "Browse Source..." and select DIR/minetest
	- Now, if using MSVC:
		- Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/minetest-build
	- Else if using MinGW:
		- Select "Browse Build..." and select DIR/minetest
	- Select "Configure"
	- Select your compiler
	- It will warn about missing stuff, ignore that at this point. (later don't)
	- Make sure the configuration is as follows
	  (note that the versions may differ for you):
	-----------------
	BUILD_CLIENT             [X]
	BUILD_SERVER             [ ]
	CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE         Release
	CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX     DIR/minetest-install
	IRRLICHT_SOURCE_DIR      DIR/irrlicht-1.7.1
	RUN_IN_PLACE             [X]
	WARN_ALL                 [ ]
	ZLIB_DLL                 DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.dll
	ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR         DIR/zlib-1.2.5
	ZLIB_LIBRARIES           DIR/zlib125dll/dll32/zlibwapi.lib
	GETTEXT_BIN_DIR          DIR/gettext/bin
	GETTEXT_INCLUDE_DIR      DIR/gettext/include
	GETTEXT_LIBRARIES        DIR/gettext/lib/intl.lib
	GETTEXT_MSGFMT           DIR/gettext/bin/msgfmt
	-----------------
	- Hit "Configure"
	- Hit "Generate"
	If using MSVC:
		- Open the generated minetest.sln
		- The project defaults to the "Debug" configuration. Make very sure to
		  select "Release", unless you want to debug some stuff (it's slower)
		- Build the ALL_BUILD project
		- Build the INSTALL project
		- You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest-install/bin/minetest.exe
		- Additionally you may create a zip package by building the PACKAGE
		  project.
	If using MinGW:
		- Using the command line, browse to the build directory and run 'make'
		  (or mingw32-make or whatever it happens to be)
		- You should now have a working game with the executable in
			DIR/minetest/bin/minetest.exe
