	Map format serialization version
	--------------------------------

		  maintained.
		  
	0: original networked test with 1-byte nodes
	1: update with 2-byte nodes
	2: lighting is transmitted in param
	3: optional fetching of far blocks
	4: block compression
	5: sector objects NOTE: block compression was left accidentally out
	6: failed attempt at switching block compression on again
	7: block compression switched on again
	8: server-initiated block transfers and all kinds of stuff
	9: block objects
	10: water pressure
	11: zlib'd blocks, block flags
	12: UnlimitedHeightmap now uses interpolated areas
	13: Mapgen v2
	14: NodeMetadata
	15: StaticObjects
	16: larger maximum size of node metadata, and compression
	17: MapBlocks contain timestamp
