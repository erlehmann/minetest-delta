Some planning
-------------

* Server environment adds an active object, which gets the id 1
* The active object list is scanned for each client once in a while,
  and it finds out what objects have been added that are not known
  by the client yet. This scan is initiated by the Server class and
  the result ends up directly to the server.
* A network packet is created with the info and sent to the client.
* Environment converts objects to static data and static data to
  objects, based on how close players are to them.
